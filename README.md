# Kiwi's Script Revisions
This mod overhauls the text script for *Majora's Mask* and makes revisions to dialogue, messages, menus and other text found in the game. This incorporates almost all the changes made to the script in the European and Gamecube versions of the game, as well as:

 - *Fixing typos, mistranslations, and grammatical errors*
   
  - *Fixing broken/incorrect textbox formatting, icons, and other effects*
   
  - *Fixing broken, incorrect, and missing dialogue sound effects*
   
  - *Fixing incorrect text colors*
   
   - *Fixing inconsistent keyword spellings, capitalization, color choices,
   and other stylistic choices*

All in all, this mod makes adjustments to over **560** unique text IDs, as well as including configuration options for several changes to allow you to use the version you prefer best.


## Usage
Requires [*LT_Schmiddy's EZ Text Replacer API*](https://thunderstore.io/c/zelda-64-recompiled/p/LT_Schmiddy/EZ_Text_Replacer_API/) to be installed and enabled.

**It is recommended that you place the Script Revisions mod close to or at the *bottom* of your mod load order to ensure maximum compatibility with other mods that also use EZTR to replace vanilla text.**

Any mods that increase text printing speed will *re-break* a large portion of the fixes for sound effects not playing in this mod (along with certain sound effects that normally work in vanilla as well).

## Special Thanks
- **LT_Schmiddy** for the EZTR API, and therefore doing the *actual* hard part in creating text replacements. 

- **Skawo** for their [fork](https://github.com/skawo/Zelda64-Text-Editor) of SageofMirrors' text editor, allowing for easy previews of the game's textboxes and perusal of other message data.

- **ShadowOne333** for uploading [documentation](https://github.com/ShadowOne333/Zelda64-Redux-Documentation/blob/master/Majora%27s%20Mask/Redux%20Assets/Text/Changes.txt) on a workaround fix for certain sound effects not playing.

- **The CloudModding Wiki** for providing useful [documentation](https://wiki.cloudmodding.com/mm/Text_Format) for control codes, sound effect IDs, and other useful information.
